		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			Trevor was born in sub-Saharan Africa where he was left behind in a village only to be found and taken in by a pride of Lions. These Lions raised him just as they would one of their own. He learned their Lions ways and they communicated telepathically. One day an alien spaceship came and abducted him when he was 6 years old. They took him to another planet where he was taught how to draw and paint. From then on he had a passion for art. He drew of his adventures with the Lion pride. After 5 years of education on this planet, Trevor was ready to bring his knowledge to the real world. His adopted alien parents dropped him back off on Earth as an 11 year old, and Trevor has made a living on his art from that day on.
